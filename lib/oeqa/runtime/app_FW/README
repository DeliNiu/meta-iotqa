Since example-app and example-session are not integrated in image by default , we need to build a specific image to test these cases.
Here are steps for how to build the image for these test cases.
1. cd <Directory of ostro>
2. source oe-init-build-env
3. Edit conf/local.conf to set IMAGE_INSTALL_append += " example-session"
4. bitbake ostro-image
5. Burn generated image to USB disk or internal eMMC
6. Boot from the image
