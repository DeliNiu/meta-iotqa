Since example-app and example-session are not integrated in image by default , we need to build a specific image to test these cases except appfw python binding cases.
Here are steps for how to build the image for these test cases.
1. cd <Directory of ostro>
2. source oe-init-build-env
3. Edit conf/local.conf to set IMAGE_INSTALL_append += " example-session"
4. bitbake ostro-image
5. Burn generated image to USB disk or internal eMMC
6. Boot from the image

For M2 test cases(appFW_M2.py) , you need to build test app(bitbake appfwTestApp) and copy 2 rpm packages(appfwTestApp, appfwtest-user) to iottest/deploy/files/target/${MACHINE}/. Pleas note, this setp is no need until we fix the rpm deploy issue.
